Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that enables computers to understand and process human language. 
It includes tasks like text analysis, translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbot interactions.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and make decisions without explicit programming. 
It includes supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

Deep Learning (DL) is a more advanced branch of ML that uses neural networks to process data in a hierarchical manner.
Popular applications include image recognition, speech processing, and autonomous vehicles.

Computer Vision is a branch of AI that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. 
It is widely used in facial recognition, medical imaging, and self-driving cars.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an area of ML where agents learn by interacting with their environment to maximize rewards.
It is used in robotics, gaming, and optimization tasks.

Generative AI refers to models that generate new content, such as text, images, music, and even code.
Examples include OpenAIâ€™s GPT models, Google's Gemini, and Stable Diffusion.
